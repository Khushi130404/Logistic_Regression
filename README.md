This repository contains an implementation of logistic regression from scratch using foundational concepts such as step function, sigmoid function, and gradient descent. Additionally, it includes an implementation using sklearn for comparison. The project also includes visualizations and comparisons of these methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of logistic regression.
